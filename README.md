# Dinner_And_A_Movie
Project 2 is a full-stack web application.  

 ## Description: 
 Stuck at home a lot more lately? Needs ideas for a perfect night in? This application will allow users to search for recipes and movie options based on their interests and save them together for a perfect movie night with their family. (We will be using 2 APIs to get information). Users will then pair their favorite movie search and dinner recipe option(s) searched from ingredients they have in their home.  If users would like to save a particular movie search, it can be saved and populated on their dashboard future reference.
