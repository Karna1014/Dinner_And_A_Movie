# Dinner_And_A_Movie
Project 2 is a full-stack web application.  

 ## Description: 
 Stuck at home a lot more lately? Needs ideas for a perfect night in? This application will allow users to search for recipes and movie options based on their interests and save them together for a perfect movie night with their family. (We will be using 2 APIs to get information). Users will then pair/store their favorite movie and dinner option(s) in a list. As they complete, they can later come back and add comments/rate the pairing. If users would like to save particular movies or dinners without pairing them, these items can be saved and populated to a different file/tab for later use.
